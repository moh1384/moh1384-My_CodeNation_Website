        <h4 class="title">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each Page</h4>

        <p>
          The Website consists of 4 pages: 1. The about me page which summarizes my background and
          experiences, skills acquired and ambitions and gaols. 2. The Unit1 has 3 outcomes with
          different subheadings which talks about the tools and software used to build the website
          and how to improve it in future applications. 3. Unit 2 to go in more details of the
          website content and constraint with copyrights when building websites and make it
          accessible for disable people

        <h4 class="title">1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h4>

        <p>
          Copyright is a serious issue when building website we have to follow the guidelines of
          each legislation to avoid falling into any problem. It affects what you able to publish
          are. The best way to overcome this is to get permission from the author. Or adding
          referencing like links to the author work
        </p>

      <div class="unit-section">
        <h4 class="title">1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h4>

        <p>
          one thing to consider is making the website accessible for people with disabilities for
          instance deaf people should have some sort of audio and voice control to help them easily
          surf the website content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-section">
        <h4 class="title">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h4>

        <p>
          The appropriate File types used for websites defers from website to another, but the
          backbone of any website is built using following file types. .HTML, which is the file,
          type for the mark-up and it the standard mark-up language for creating any website. .CSS,
          which is used to style the Mark-up written in HTML. .JPG, GIF, PNG … etc are different
          photos file format with different resolution, again depends on everyone’s need. Documents
          for instance have their own format, which may include PDF, Text …. etc This is all to do
          with the UI. Then when it comes to the programing languages for the website
          functionalities it will depend on the language used, for instance java script will have a
          .js file format and python will have .py …etc.
