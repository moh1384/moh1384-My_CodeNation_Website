        1.1 Purpose of IT in Modern Business
      </h4>     
                    
          <p>
            Information technology had completely shifted today’ businesses, One simple example is
            from being just basic stores where peoples had to walk to stores for shopping to be
            digital and reach costumers doors by a simple click where you will be offered various
            services that offers same outcome as you never left your couch. And it doesn’t just stop
            at this point, lots of other benefits IT add to businesses to promote their growth, to
            include accounting software, tills and logistics and more and more. An import use of
            technology in business is communication, and when we say communication is through
            different platforms like email, messaging software, video calls to hold meetings and one
            to one sessions like interviews and save peoples and businesses time and money to
            travel. One simple example is the current pandemic situation where employees had to work
            from home. In fact without IT none of that could be achievable.

              Taking for instance creating a web page, which is not an easy and quick task to
              perform and require different tools, skills, bellow I am summarizing the main points:
              . Designing the UI using different tools like photoshop, big corporations have their
              own design team. . Front-end developers Building the UI using different tools to
              include HTML, CSS, Javascript, python for functionalities. . Back-end developers to
              look after a database sitting somewhere in some sever where it need its own language
              like Nodejs. Mongo DB. . We might require a special team to look after the website
              security and to offer a safe place to surf the web. . Using a management software to
              split the tasks and track the progress against the deadline like trello

            Building My Website was a bit challenging, Like you need to think about what’s the design is going to be like, is it doibale with the tools in hand? Does it fall into my knowledge Frame or I need to look the web to learn new things? 
            I started by searching the web for some website ideas and putting examples in a list, and a few only where shortlisted. Main steps are listed below:
              •	Researching the web for the different questions and writing the answers in Microsoft word for spelling and errors.  
              •	The HTML Mark-up and building the website structure. 
              •	CSS styling and layout.
              •	Referencing each external resource.
              •	Testing for any bugs and see the outcome in different Browsers.

              1.4 Risks that might impact digital projects:
            </h4>
            <p  >
              Risks are everywhere, so digital project is not an exception, how you manage risks
              without impacting the progress of project is what makes a good management stands out
              as a key element in any successful project. Many examples can give us a brief idea of
              what makes a project at stake. Some points are summarized below: • You begin a 6-month
              long website build project. Two months in, Apple releases a new version of iOS, and
              the site you have in development doesn’t work properly on the new iOS version. •
              Halfway through a project, your company merges with another company, which has a very
              different go-to-market strategy. • Three months into a website build project, a
              competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw your customers
              away. • A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through
              the project. Things that makes a project to fail is planning, planning is the key, A
              good planning process will attempt to identify as many of the unknowns as possible,
              allowing you to put mitigation plans in place, and increasing the probability that
              your project will end on time and on budget.

              how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? IT systems and software
              are made to brings ease and save both time and money for any business. Achieving
              better results will imply using the right piece of software, taking for instance
              building a website. Where different software achieve different results. A JavaScript
              Frame work like react for instance will allow the use of SPA or single page
              application that offers fast and unique user experience. Server selection: Deploying
              the website requires attention to many details like how fast and reliable and secure
              the server. How big is the data to be deployed? How fast is the interaction with the
              server?

              1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
            </h4>           

            <p  >
              For my website, I used HTML5 for the mark up and CSS3 for styling which both can be
              used in Visual Studio, this last has many features to include extensions for instance
              to control the code format to make it readable for further website maintenance or
              modification. Trello helped organizing the different tasks and moving them from to do,
              doing, done made the project run smoothly where the job was cut into parts and each
              dealt with separately and gathering the whole at the end. Version control allows you
              to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore the changes you have made,
              be it data, coding scripts, notes, etc. You are probably already doing some type of
              version control, if you save multiple files. This approach will leave you with tens or
              hundreds of similar files, making it rather cumbersome to directly compare different
              versions, and is not easy to share among collaborators. With version control software
              such as Git, version control is much smoother and easier to implement. Using an online
              platform like Github to store your files means that you have an online backup of your
              work, which is beneficial for both you and your collaborators.

              1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
            </h4>

            <p  >
              The GDPR itself was an expansion on the DPA Data Protection Act which sets guidelines
              on how data is handled within the EU economic region. With regards to the GDPR’s to
              legal guidelines and constraints that affect a business that runs digital projects
              it's very similar to any other company, but with a special emphasis on copyright law
              which we will disscuss later on and data protection, which in Europe is underlined by
              the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation. This regulation has been implemented
              in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all
              companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe,
              including companies on other continents. Expansion made under the GDPR includes ; The
              right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their
              personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been
              gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in
              electronic format if requested. The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer
              customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal
              data, then they have the right to have their data deleted. The right to data
              portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service
              provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable
              format.

              Making my own website was quite a challenge. Researching different questions was a bit
              tricky looking for the right content and resources following guidelines for data
              protection. The project was split in two main parts, first was researching and second
              was the mark up and styling. Trello was the main key to achieve the results I was
              looking for in the requires time, different question varied in terms of difficulty and
              time consumption, and with the use of different cards allowed me to split my time to
              better result achievement. Visual studio meanwhile is a perfect tool in my opinion for
              coders, a wide choice of feature to include extensions to better manage and style your
              code as a professional. And the easy to interact with UI where bugs and faults are easy

            <p  >
              Trello was useful as a task management tool, it helps setting the different tasks and
              updating the progress along the way. Time management, which is key to meet deadlines.
              Visual studio I believe is the number one used in the industry and most popular among
              the coding family. A wide variety of features and extension help a lot when writing and
              styling the project. One of the features that I love is live server, which updates
              content on the browser after saving. Good for testing and saved me from refreshing every
              time.

            professional UI for the user to interact with. To some extent, I am happy with the
            project as somehow it ticked the boxes for this assignment. However, with deepening my
            skills further I would give more features and great user experience. Improving it to a
            full stack website requesting all information from a back end api for example, building
            functions to interact the back end … etc . to be implemented in further projects

            From my point of view, the project can be improved in a way to give the user a full
            stack website experience with data as a form of API in a back end server and interacting
            with the data by coding different functions. Alternatively, the use of framework like

            the project. More efficient would be saying more time for collecting more data and using
            languages or frameworks for better User experience. Having a team would give a better

            Best solution to improve productivity is improving owns skills, the project can take a
